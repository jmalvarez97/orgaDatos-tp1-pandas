       "'Ate here for the 1st time on Saturday 08/07/2020. \\nThe food was ok, had the Lobster Boil . The Lobster was ok for a soft shelled Lobster. The Crabs were soggy and mushy. The Clams were gummy and snotty . The headed shrimp were large and tasty. All the items were precooked, obviously. The fish spread was decent , also had the Fried Shrimp and Shrimp scampi  which were decent. BYOB ... ... The atmosphere was nice except for the zillion Flies. I\\'ll be back with a six packAbsolutely fantastic!!!!  I\\'ll be back for sure. Fried lobster tail was delicious. Five star for sure.I was sadly disappointed in my experience. We ordered crabs and they were extremely small, watery and over half were bad(sick crabs), we ordered beans and rice which lacked flavor and literally had one bean in it that you can see from the picture. The coleslaw also lacked taste. We ask for grouper nuggets and a few were not cooked all the way. So given the food experience it was nothing like the reviews we read. Why I am giving them three stars is because the waitress that waited on us (young pregnant girl) was EXTREMELY polite and an excellent server. The owner came by our table and greeted us which is something not done often these days. They also took half off the crabs since half were bad trying to make it right but in the end we paid over $50 (including tip) for food that we barley ate and had to go to McDonald\\'s after. \\nI did see other food that may have been better choices but we came for the crab.Great new local seafood spot. It\\' actually real seafood! Great atmosphere! BYOB encouraged.This is a food truck alongside a picnic area. The atmosphere is fine--outdoor and casual.  They don\\'t serve any alcohol...byob.  Service is great.  Food is meh!Great place for group of friends to meet & eat the freshest seafood in New Port Richie!  Friendly and very casual!   The chef answered questions and made great recommendations!   Servings were very generous with a really good slaw!  Pricing very reasonable considering the quality and portions!   We will come back again.  The menu changes with the daily catch so we will try the next new thing Frankie cooks up!Blown away how fun and awesome this little gem is! The atmosphere is so fun and festive and the garlic shrimp and fried lobster to die for! Cannot wait to go back and get some blue crabs steamed Baltimore style!!! It was a cold night but the heaters were perfect. It\\'s BYOB which is also the bomb.comNever would have thought a little hidden place like this would have such great food! We had oysters garlic shrimp and crab cakes and everything was amazing ! It was so good I forgot to take pictures before I devoured everything! Will definitely be back !Finale a local Fresh seafood place to go to. Had the top neck clams & crabs. Great job guys. Thanks see you again with our corona 6 pack.EVERYTHING we had on this menu was amazing . The stone crab claws are a must try, the sweet plantains, the garlic butter shrimp. All delicious. Service was awesome , just a nice laid  back place and you can BYOB. Our server annmarie was attentive and friendly. We met the owner Frankie and his family who were personable, friendly and went out of their way to make sure our daughter Bella had a great experience. Definitely will be back :)Be careful before ordering the coleslaw, I found a rusted push pin in mine. When I showed it to the waitress she apologized and said it came from the board above where food is prepared. Just thankful that I did not eat the pin, can\\'t image the internal damage it could have done.  I was offered a free desert but passed on that. Don\\'t know if I would go back.Unfortunately the site for Frankie\\'s is incorrect on hours. When I called and got no answers assumed they were closed. Frankie call me back to say they were in fact open! That never happens so we went and found a diamond in the rough and a fantastic fresh seafood eatery. Joe the chef is a super nice guy and even better cook. Had ridiculously fresh oysters, fish dip, and lobster meal that rivaled the best we ever tasted. It\\'s a byob, which I love also. We are only in Port Richey for a couple days but will likely eat there the rest of our evenings. Get there before everyone finds out and the wait is in the hours! Well done Frankie and thanks for bringing us in!What a fantastic casual seafood or BBQ local secret. No frills just amazing food. It was the best oysters I\\'ve had in decades.This location is right of of state road 54.\\n\\nNice location to sit outside on a nice day. \\n\\nI ordered to go my order was ready in 10 minutes \\n\\nThe staff was very polite \\n\\nMy food was hot, fresh and tasty! The potion of coleslaw was huge an my lobster was a nice size. \\n\\nI will be coming backDon\\'t drive by ... STOP at this \"Old Florida\" spot on 54!  Everything is fresh and delicious ... oh, and entertaining too!  Oysters on the half shell, raw cherry stone clams, fish spread, peel & eat shrimp, and Boom Boom shrimp appetizers - all excellent.  Triple Threat with triple tail, scallops and shrimp - blackened to your liking.  Crab cakes are great! Dozen blue crab may be the winner - to die for - and fun to eat!  Fish and chips with sea bass - sooo good!  Waiting to try the key lime dessert. But so far, everyone will be back!I love this place. Nice place for the girls to hang out, or grab some delicious food. It\\'s a byob, so bring your favorite drink, kick back and relax. I like the Zen garden. Delightful when everything is in bloom. \\nOwners are pleasant as are the waitresses. \\nWill be returning with family.YUM! Such a cool place for lunch or dinner, love the atmosphere and the food is great! Staff is friendly!Shrimp and all other seafood is always cooked to perfection! Can\\'t wait to come back :)Great atmosphere to match the incredible food and staff. The establishment makes you feel so comfortable and warm you don\\'t want to leave! I had the Cuban Empanadas\\'s and they were delicious  I ordered the baked beans also and they were some of the best I\\'ve ever had. I can\\'t wait to keep going back until I\\'ve had everything on the menu....Twice!!!!the only place to get raw clams!!!!!! Shucked correctly\\n\\noh and the conch fritters are \"award winning\" !!!Awesome raw bar /fish shack. Exactly how I love to eat.I got oysters, shrimp and the mahi. Can\\'t wait to return!!Great little spot and best of all BYOB !!!!\\nLove it \\n\\nIs the food was fresh coat and they brought in the stone crabs that night on ice !  The boiled shrimp are great and the outside seating makes it feel very old Florida which is cool  , oysters Rockefeller was  pretty good.... \\n\\nLocal - down home - good seafood !\\n\\nLoved the stone crabs with melted butterSuper cute local spot, great fresh seafood, and fun backyard dining. This place reminds me a lot of the keys.Excellent food and service. Portions are a little light on the seafood, but top quality. Road was noisy.Hidden gem in NPR. Ordered the stone crabs, crab cakes, shrimp and fried lobster. Delicious! I highly recommend. The service is great, the food is awesome, bring your own drinks and let the good times roll.'"

       "'Do they forget your items sometimes? Yep.\\nDo they forget to salt the beans sometimes? Yep\\nBut in the end, you get what you get. This is Nicos. They all have their ups and downs. This place has always treated me and my significant other well. We enjoy it often.Was reluctant as there were mixed reviews, but decided to give them a try. I had the 3 rolled tacos ($3.19 really?  What a deal!) and they were deliciousThis Nicos has a salsa bar which is nice. I enjoyed my food as I do from their other locations. Chile relleno burrito, get in my belly!The nacho supreme is the best ever with lots of carne asada and no shortage of guacamole and sour cream. Plus I like their hot ads salsa to dress it with rather than glorified tomato paste.Horrible customer service. I ask for my carne asada cooked extra well done and cook just never gives a damn. I repeatedly ask them too and double check before they give me order but always fail. Never fail to mess up my order. I live 1 block away, but i will continue to just go to the ina location. They have way better service, food is better, fresh.If I could give a negative rating I would say -5!! New owners suck. If u can\\'t get breakfast burrito\\'s right you probably shouldn\\'t own a Nico\\'s!! Worst service and can\\'t get orders right to save their lives! In all honesty it\\'s the fourth or fifth time!! And they do\\nNothing when brought to their attention! They suck!!Nico\\'s has the best breakfast burritos in town. The portion size is large.  The large flour tortillas are packed full and the food it always hot. The people who take your order could use a little education in civility and maybe remembering that the customers are who pay their wages-- but its worth being treated like a pain in the a** when you bite into that delicious burrito!Went here based off yelp reviews but what I received was not like the reviews. My tortilla fell apart on my burrito the potatoes were hard and the place was not very clean. Will not be returning after that experience. One star for the salsa and carrots that was good. But wouldn\\'t even be willing to try again. Very sad.Great customer service and overall good food. Great portion sizes compared to the price of the meal. Tortillas were house-made and built for burrito endurance. Carne Asada burrito was pretty much the size of my forearm. Churros were delicious and freshly made per order. The place was clean and cleaned after we left. Only complaint: guacamole was pretty much just mashed avocado, no doctoring, no salt or pepper or onions or tomatoes or anything. Would have liked a little more flavor, but it was served with pico, so it wasn\\'t completely unforgivable.Huuuuuge Bacon egg (no potato filler) y con kwesso and they have the Medio litro Coca Cola with cane sugar!! Awesome sauce taco shop and our new breakfast burrito stop! 2 legit 2 quitBreakfast burritos for life!! They have decent lunch/dinner options, too, but some can be kinda greasy and they\\'re basically akin to fast food in terms of quality. But their breakfast burritos are a thing of beauty, like manna from heaven. They\\'re the truth. All that is good and right in the world. If you haven\\'t had one yet, make it a priority to do so!Wow, needed some food on the drive home.  This place is rocking, great rolled tacos and the rice is a stand-out!Ordered a chorizo, egg and cheese breakfast burrito and started eating it when I got home.  It had a long black hair in it.  So disgusting.  NEVER going here again!!!Huge let down! I had visited Nico\\'s Taco Shop approximately two(2)years ago when I was in Marana for training and absolutely loved my visit.  The food was decent but the service was what made the patronage worth it.  I could not say the same about my visit this time around. Horrible customer service! No greeting, no personality, no knowledge of how to deal with the public(customer) at all.  News flash: when you serve subpar Mexican food in southern Arizona, you better be on your game when it comes to engaging and pleasing your customers.  I can guarantee that this was my last visit, next time I will visit Nana\\'s Kitchen which is right across the street.After having the same kind of unsanitary situations at the Ina Road Nico\\'s location I decided to give the Cortaro a try desperate for a good bean burrito apparently I can\\'t even go here as soon as I had already paid for my order I watch The Cook wipe his nose with a tissue and throw it in the trash and not wash his hands and use those same hands to prepare my food and the five people behind me I decided that it wasn\\'t worth the battle to embarrass myself in front of all the customers so I decided to just take the food and throw it in the trash but I ordered everyone to stay away from this place and hopefully the health department can inspect it because that is disgusting it\\'s repulsiveThis is a great Nico\\'s at least as good as the one on Campbell. Terrific chile relleno and carne asada burrow, great salsas both green and red. How come only 3 star average?I have been here three times recently, as I am staying at a nearby hotel- within walking distance. I had the fish taco\\'s twice and a combination plate of one chicken taco & one beef taco tonight. All three meals were tasty. Also very generous portions. It will fill you up. Service was prompt. Place was busy. They seem to have a good business going.This is one of the worst Mexican food places we\\'ve experienced so far.  The carne is under seasoned, watered down salsa, and just unpleasant in general.  Definitely don\\'t recommend this Nico\\'s compared to the others in town.I\\'m not usually one to leave reviews; however, I felt as though one was warranted. On arrival  I asked the cashier specifically if they\\'re super nachos had beans, considering I didn\\'t want beans, the cashier told me no. I placed my order and once received the food needed salt, which no big deal but I also wasn\\'t given salsa which could\\'ve helped the situation. To make matters worse halfway through the nachos I realized that they came with beans even though I was told otherwise. Overall not my best experience and don\\'t plan on returning.I stopped for a breakfast burrito. I ordered a chorizo burrito to go. The cook failed to drain the grease from the meat. By the time I got to work, the bottom part of the bag was soaked with grease; as well as, my passenger seat. I could only eat the top half of the burrito because the bottom part had fallen apart.  $7 is pretty pricy for half a burrito.I give this place 5 stars for what they are. All they really need is a drive thru! Hot fresh food with friendly staff.We were passing through from a sale in Tucson and wanted Mexican food close to the exit we were at. Nico\\'s was the closest and yes we read the reviews and went anyway! We were not disappointed! They have amazing fish tacos and enchiladas! DON\\'T believe everything you read. This is good affordable food and lots of it! Enjoy!! I wish you had a place in Chandler, AZ!I ordered a carnitas taco and two cheese enchiladas. The taco meat was so overdone that it was hard to eat. Next the two cheese enchiladas were not even heated. The cheese had never melted on mine or my buddies enchiladas. \\nThere are big signs saying no refunds so this must happen often. \\nI suggest that you skip dining at this place. At the very least, I expect that it\\'s not too much to expect your food to be cooked. No mas Nicos tacos!I have been a count less amount of time and I love it I get a number 1 breakfast burrito with no cheese I love it. I love how they cook the bacon and eggBest breakfast burritos in town! Most of the staff here is very friendly. Love that they have a self-serve salsa bar. I consider myself a regular here!You get a lot of food for the price.  All three of our meals were loaded with salt and not very tasty. The staff was super nice and very accommodating.I wish this place had a negative score because it deserves less than one star. I\\'ll just start off by saying we have been to the several Nico\\'s Shop in town with no complaints, but this Cortaro Rd location is by far the worst one. We came home and what was supposed to be a Carne Asada Burrito (with added egg) ended up having barely carne asada with just ALL egg. We had to drive and bring the burrito back, explaining in a friendly way, what our order should have been (thinking they may have misunderstood us). Martha (the lady at the register) was rude and ONLY added sour cream and pico, & left the rest of the order as is. Clearly they had to add all this extra egg for the lack of carne asada to make more money on people. There was also HAIR in the burrito (not sure if she did this on purpose). \\n\\nLet me also point out that this was NOT the first time we were disappointed by this location & was hoping they would improve.\\n\\nTHIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU WILL GET IN TOWN. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. You are better off going to other Nico\\'s locations. \\n\\n(I recommend Nico\\'s on Ina Rd., different owner, not much farther but way better service and they do business the right way!)I enjoy their food but quite frankly it is become quite overpriced and is something I no longer consider a good value.  Once you get a burrito and a drink it\\'s almost the cost of some sit down restaurants.  This something I find difficult to swallow from a place whose decor looks like it\\'s from the 70s and the cleanliness seems barely acceptable.We frequent Nico\\'s for burritos. In the past year EVERYTHING about this location has gone down hill! We always order the same things, yet when we receive the orders they are never the same. They are incapable of customizing anything.  We always order the California burrito with chicken, and bacon egg potato and cheese with easy potato. Sometimes they tell us they can\\'t make the California with chicken, sometimes they tell us they don\\'t understand, sometimes when we very specifically ask for the grilled chicken we receive shredded, we have also received a whole chicken breast (not cut up at all!). The woman who works at the counter is HORRIBLE, she is terribly rude and says nasty things about customers in Spanish evidently not knowing we can understand her because we order in English. We have gotten cold food, wrong orders, terrible service and now it\\'s nearly every time we\\'re in there. NOT WORTH IT ANYMORE!! Going to the Ina or Marana location from now on! Don\\'t waste your time and money at the Cortaro location!Placed a phone order, the lady who answered was very unprofessional and acted like she couldn\\'t talk. Bacon was undercooked. Practically raw. Eggs were hard and old and there were only a very few potatoes in the # 1 breakfast burrito which were also undercooked. This is my go to order, has been for years, but I\\'ve never been to this location until tonight and never will again. Ina location is 10x better.  0 stars for this location if I could.Hard to see in this image but they\\'ve add a hanging plexiglass shield (to the left of the guy in gray) to separate you from the employee. Still have to hand your card over if paying without cash. \\n\\nAlso you can ask for salsa (red or green) they closed the salsa self serve bar. Employees are wearing masks (typically).I am a huge Nicos fan but this location is not the best at all. I received a bone or rock in my carne asada. It chipped my molar tooth. Very disappointed and scared to go back.I ordered a beef taco and a green taco. Both tacos split in half when I picked them up, so I had to eat them with a fork, HOWEVER the beef was absolutely delicious!! The green taco was a little spicy, but the shredded cabbage on top helped cool down the spice level. It would be great if there was a hard shell option!I went here almost everyday while I was pregnant. I love the burritos.\\nHowever, I came in the other day and noticed the cook wasn\\'t wearing gloves while handling my food. I feel that\\'s pretty gross, especially considering COVID.Food- 5 stars\\nService-1 star\\n\\nI ordered the number one breakfast burrito. While it was only supposed to have bacon, egg,cheese,and potato, it also had sausage and ham in it. I can\\'t complain about the extra ingredients because they were equally delicious. The burrito was large, hot, and fresh and I enjoyed it. \\n\\nThe salsa was watered down, which was disappointing.\\n\\nThe girl at the counter and her two cook friends ignored me and another party whilst looking at a cellphone video and laughing. When I said excuse me, she turned around on one heel as if she were annoyed that it\\'s her job to greet customers and take orders.  I also asked for the burrito to be cut in half and she forgot in the three minutes it took to prepare the burrito. \\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for good food and bad attitudes, you\\'ll find them both here.Nicos, what can I say? We have had our good times and our bad but these days the times we share are definitely in a down swing. \\n\\nMy family and I frequently go to Nico\\'s because we love the breakfast burritos. Prices under $6.00 the value is great. We always order a number 1 (eggs, potatoes, bacon, and cheese) without the bacon as we are vegetarians. \\n\\nOn several occasions we have had to pick out pieces of bacon. In the burrito I had today there were large pieces of sausage and small pieces of bacon. My husbands burrito didn\\'t have sausage but there was plenty of bacon pieces. \\n\\nI learned today that I need to clearly state that we do not eat meat. Simply ordering a burrito without bacon will not guarantee that bacon isn\\'t included or even sausage.Not sure why they get poor reviews but I\\'ve gone to this location more than a few times and have never had a problem with service or the quality of food. It\\'s Nicos, what are people expecting? If you wanted a slightly nicer sit down restaurant, go across the street to Nanas. Nicos is predominantly a take out location so the table area isn\\'t the best but I enjoy the breakfast burritos and shredded chicken burritos. They\\'re quick and have always answered the phones promptly. Also haven\\'t ever had a problem with them forgetting items. All in all, quick takeout at Nico\\'s is a good choice!Ordered from Postmates 3 burritos, 1 quesadilla. My order arrived with 2.5 burritos because one of them was nearly empty, and a tostada instead of a quesadilla. I guess both ends with the letter \"a\" so... Also, no salsa??? Who sends out to go orders with no salsa? Trash. \\n\\nHonestly, this particular Nico\\'s never fails to disappoint.  My orders are almost always wrong and the food isn\\'t as good as other locations. Drive the extra 8 minutes to the Ina location, you\\'ll be happierI like their food alright. It\\'s not the worst for fast Mexican food. I got the carne Assada fries. There is plenty of meat and toppings. I would say however the food is  overpriced slightly. And the customer service , well just think of a millennial trying to give good customer service but needs more training-that\\'s what you can  expect. I guess putting down the phone is something we all have to work on...Awesome food and always caters to our special instructions even going above and beyond. We enjoy ordering takeout at least once a week from Nicos on Cortaro Rd. Highly recommended‼'"

       "'Came here with coworkers for a quick business outing / meeting. It\\'s Tuesday so we ordered the dollar tacos .. literally worst tacos I\\'ve ever had . To be fair I haven\\'t have anything else off the menu except the dollar tacos, but they were enough to deter me from returning . I\\'m Mexican, I know good tacos and those were terrible ! Service was pretty bad too, I wouldn\\'t recommend it20 minutes for nothing. Walked in. Hostess asked for 5 minutes while there obviously 10+ tables open for service. Sat down to some decent chips and salsa. No service for 5-10 minutes. I walked to the bar to figure out what was going on. Grabbed an extra salsa from the bar and asked the hostess what was the deal. She said she would get a waiter right away. He never showed up. We left 5 minutes later. Oh well.Came tonight for a light dinner, arriving at around 5. Only 1 other table taken in the entire restaurant and they sit us in a booth that was dirty and had seeds stuck to it. Not off to a good start.\\n\\nWe started with the complimentary chips and salsa and ordered a small queso, which was good although clumpy. Ordered a tamale, only to sadly find out they were out of. We also ordered chicken quesadillas (al carte) and were given the option of shredded chicken or grilled and picked grilled ... mistake! When it came out it was huge chunks of chicken and the quesadilla didn\\'t even close over it. Also had a beef taco which I can only describe as mushy. We sat with empty drinks for quite awhile until I asked for a refill. \\n\\nWe wanted dessert and asked what they had. At first we were leaning toward churros, but my little girl was hoping it was a churro sundae. It wasn\\'t and our sever shared that it\\'s actually pretty dry so don\\'t order and we\\'d \"save him a trip.\" Nice.\\nHowever, we ordered a flan, only to find out 5 minutes later that they were out of it, too ... our sever explained they made a bad batch and had to throw it all out. Grr.\\n\\nI\\'ve always liked Vallarta\\'s, but definitely won\\'t be back to this location.This is probably my favorite place to come and get Mexican food. My waiter was very attentive to me and my family. My drinks was filled without getting low. Food was excellent would definitely recommend this locationWhat a joke!!!  Waited 1.5 hours more than the 35 minute wait they told us. Then waited hour for food only to have it all COLD!!  Never will be back.  U don\\'t deserve any stars!!!Not sure how this place has 2.5 stars! When we come, we are typically seated immediately. Free chips and salsa-- and the salsa is amazing! Chips are great too, not at all oily. If you come, you MUST get the mixed fajitas. They are the best fajitas I\\'ve ever had (and I\\'ve had a lot of fajitas), and they come with tortillas, rice, beans, guac, and salad for $15! Me and my fiancé typically share one order and we are both full and satisfied at the end. I would HIGHLY recommend Vallarta\\'s on 56th! Can\\'t speak for the other locations.Service was hit or miss. Sat down without a menu or utensils and wasn\\'t greeted for about 15 minutes. Fajitas were good. More onions and bell peppers Than actual beef. House margaritas are good and strong without that tart taste. Overall atmosphere was good. And so was the food.I will NEVER come here again. We asked for a table for 7 people and as we sat down our server was talking to the people at the table next to us saying how he didn\\'t feel like serving us. He continued to talk about how he just wanted to go home and how we had the nerve to show up at 8:30pm when his shift ended at 9:00pm and he just wanted to go home. He clearly looked at us while making all his rude comments, making it obvious that he was talking about us. We felt extremely uncomfortable and just left. As we were walking out he sarcastically said \"Bye!! Thanks for making my life a whole lot easier!\". I feel so disrespected and annoyed, never again.Taco Tuesday and Thursday.  It\\'s so good you have to go twice in one week.  Not to mention they have $1 night tacos and margarita specials!!! The dollar tacos are great quality and they give you plenty of meat and cheese in them.The food is a 5. Every time I have come out I have loved what they offer. Their nachos are extra cheesy and their chicken is perfectly seasoned. The only reason I didn\\'t give a full 5 is because the ambiance is lacking. Big time. I\\'m the type of person that expects the restaurant to be up and running at time of opening, meaning everything is ready to go. Every time I go to this place they just seem unprepared for business. The music is off, rice isn\\'t finished cooking and the hot sauce, salt and pepper shakers aren\\'t full. I\\'m not picky by all means but I feel like the details matter a whole lot and really help a consumer want to return. They need to work on their details because the food is actually really good. The place also has a bit of a musty smell when you first walk in. So whenever We do go, my husband and I wonder if we should even stay because the smell is kind of bad. We do end up staying because the food is good and we\\'re hungry. So I think you should definitely try if you can ignore the above mentioned stuff and taste what they have to offer. If not, anyone know any authentic Mexican restaurants worth trying? Let me know!Sitting here at the bar waiting for my food to go, just minding my business. I see a bartender make a margarita. For those who are margarita fans you\\'re drinking it out of a Mayson\\'s Margarita Mix jug, and a tiny splash of cheap tequila. Second, the chips they greet you with are in plastic bins next to a warmer, which they fill up when it is empty with the old chips in the bins. They scoop chips into the baskets with bare hands, who knows what they go in the back and do. \\nThink to yourself, is this what you call authenticity? I will never come back here!Save your time and money and go to the Tampa Palms location. Waaaay better service and food.Just went there for lunch and had the fajita Quesadillas. All in all, pretty good. My only complaint is the fact there wasn\\'t much cheese in my quesadilla. However, the meat and vegetables were off the charts fresh and tasty.Service used to be good not so much anymore. After many run ins with food inspectors its an eat at your own risk thing. One waiter is awesome but everyone else not so much. Good margaritas though! \\n\\nUpdated!!  Do not eat the chips!!!! They don\\'t use gloves. Watched him handle trash and then dip his hands in there - aahhhhh!I\\'ve been coming to this restaurant for almost 30 years.  I\\'ve seen it through highs and lows.  Lately though, quality has plummeted.  This was the first Vallarta\\'s in Tampa but I\\'d recommend one of their other locations instead - Wesley Chapel is my favorite.  I mostly keep coming for the cheap lunch specials on Saturdays and the proximity to my apartment.  The service is hit or miss.  One waiter is usually fantastic and remembers me and what I like to order.  Some days, though, they\\'re short staffed.  The day I\\'m writing this, the only employee on the floor is the owner, though there\\'s a guy behind the bar who can\\'t stop watching a soccer game long enough to lend a hand and bus some tables or refill some drinks.  And the owner is absolutely terrible as a waiter.  \\n\\nThe food is good.  It isn\\'t amazing, it\\'s barely authentic, especially when you consider a majority of the staff is Mexican.  But it\\'s good for a fairly low price.  Their salsa is one of my favorites and trust me, I know my salsas.  The happy hour margaritas are good but over priced when you consider they typically have a splash of tequila.  Also, what kind of happy hour doesn\\'t have a beer option?\\n\\nA \"fun\" new thing they\\'re doing lately (or maybe it\\'s just me because I\\'m a \"regular\" is not bringing a check to the table and expecting you to just go up front and the person ringing you up will wing it. That makes me feel really wanted and definitely secure about my totals.  Also, good luck getting refills on drinks or chips or asking for more napkins.  \\n\\nRealistically, I could just walk another half mile and eat at TacoSon but I\\'m tired and lazy, ok??  Give me my tacos de asada, tasty salsa, and mediocre service.Don\\'t be fooled by their outside patio with tables and chairs, you are not allowed to sit there. Hostess was sour and did not inform us that food preparation would be delayed due to large party. Hostess was cold when asked questions. She was also missing when we were ready to pay at the front. Only ordered two drinks, did not order food due to wait. Horrible experience.Tacos are like a $1 every Tuesday and their margarita pitchers are super cheaper for the amount you get and they are strong and yummy!! Endless chips and salsa!! Best chips and salsa I\\'ve had! We come every Tuesday, and the waiters are always so welcoming and friendly. It\\'s to the point where the waiter recognizes us! I look forward to eating here!This place was so bad, I even took time to download the app to leave a review. I had better Mexican food in Michigan. I had combo 14,   burrito, enchilada, tamale. The tortilla was store brought and tasted old. The tamale tasted like it was froze after cooking the first tim, even had freezer burn. My husband got the wrong order, and it was just cover in lettuce. We ordered the kids tenders, got chicken nuggets(if you have a toddler, you know why we are up set with this). This place was really bad.Hard to pass up a place like Vallartas when they offer dollar tacos and $9 32oz margaritas daily! It feels like one big family here. Everyone is very friendly and warm, and make you feel right at home. You get free refillable chips and salsa with your meals...and did i mention $9 32oz margaritas?? One of my favorite restaurants in Tampa.This was my first time at Vallarta and as soon as we walked to the front door, I suspected a problem. The glass doors are your first impression of the place and they were dirty. Very dirty. Our waitress sat us down and my silverware and our menus were dirty. Our waiter even came out to take our order with filthy oven mitts still on his hands. \\n\\nSince I\\'m from out of town and didn\\'t know what to expect, I was hoping for some good, authentic Mexican food. I was very disappointed. The food was very bland and lacked spice and flavor except for an overwhelming cheesy sauce that was on my chimichanga. I don\\'t recommend this place. \\n\\nThe staff was nice though, the restaurant itself was cute but it was dirty. Even the windows we sat next to inside the restaurant were smeared from the inside. I\\'d avoid this place.Not sure why this place rates so low. The food, service and beverages are solid!  We enjoyed the visit and stayed for three rounds and a few hours.  Cute restaurant and would go again in a heartbeat!I ordered a mushroom quesadilla, delicious!\\nits not in the menu, because I am vegetarian and I don\\'t eat onions, they made something different and delicious., thank you!Solid 4 stars for this Vallarta location! It\\'s a bit crowded at times, but that is usually a good sign when you\\'re looking for a place to eat. The service can be a bit slow and sometimes they have a lot of trouble understanding your order, but if you can be patient you will enjoy your visit. I\\'ve been here several times and each time has been pretty good and always entertaining.\\n\\nThe drinks are really the spotlight. Get a margarita, or two or a pitcher. Just make sure you have a ride home because they are STRONG!! The food is really delicious and very reasonably priced. They have lunch specials as well which are really good deals. This past visit I had a (GIANT) beef taco and chile poblano for around $6 total. I love going during Happy Hour (2-7pm everyday) because margaritas are BOGO and beer is really cheap. On Monday & Tuesdays, tacos are only $1 which is a STEAL. Great flavor and a large menu of items to choose from overall.Never a bad choice. Vallarta\\'s is just a feel good place! I love the decor, the service, the food and that it\\'s family owned. I\\'m so happy they\\'ve been able to stay in business all of this time!Lovely service; fast, nice and quiet.\\nMake sure you come hungry! This place gives a ton of food. Literally the best quesadilla I have ever had.I stopped going to Vallarta\\'s after their food really started to slide in quality and I started feeling not so good after leaving their restaurant. I don\\'t recommend it to anyone or any of its affiliates.I loved the food. \\n\\nThis is a fairly safe place to eat if you have Celiac disease, except maybe for the chips, since they are prone to cross-contamination with other glutenous products. I enjoy the serving sizes and flavor. \\n\\nCustomer service can make or break any place for me, though:\\n\\nThe waiter, after having been advised that there was bright red lipstick found on a glass earlier served, did not apologize nor take our word for it. He even proceeded to inspect the glass as if he needed to confirm our complaint. When cited for attitude, he became apparently offended, and a completely avoidable negative outcome followed. \\n\\nI can no longer go to this restaurant and feel safe enough to know the staff won\\'t add ingredients foreign to the provided menu to my food. \\n\\nGoodbye, Vallarta Mexican Restaurant on 56th street in Temple Terrace. I hope you find better employees to carry your brand.The service was as bad as the food!  The sour cream was curds.  The nachos were drenched in a nasty unflavored cheese sauce.  The chips at the bottom were soggy because of the sauce.  \\n\\nThe Flatus had fat in both of the two I tried to eat.  When we showed the server he made an excuse, \"The meat we buy has a lot of fat on it\". I\\'m sorry, that shouldn\\'t be a problem your customers should have to endure.  He didn\\'t even try to correct the problem, he slipped me the tab.  I forgot that I pre ordered Churros.  But after the service of bad excuse and a horrible experience, we didn\\'t want anything else from this place.If I could give it 0 stars I would . We got there and waited several minutes to be served even though there was only one other table in the building . The waiter could not understand our order and when we did get our drinks there was stuff in them . We got our food which was missing everything we ordered inside of it and was charged to have it added . We tried to have our bill explained to us and was told this is what we ordered . 3 little tacos and 2 burritos cost us $51 ! We will never come back and recommend no one else waste their time here . Taco son is 4 minutes up the street and way better .\"TRY FOR YOURSELF\" .... I\\'ve read  a lot of reviews and decided to make my own conclusion due to me not caring about people\\'s complaint about not getting Ruth chris service but receiving good food lol. And might I add the food we had was AMAZING, FRESH,  SEASONED and HOT. \\n\\nI had the new street tacos that were on the front of the menu & my kids shared the fajitas that were perfect. Tacos I had were  better than any food truck I\\'ve been to in Florida (been to quite a few) & the steak that\\'s used here is actually RIBEYE! Very pleased with the food drinks and price. Will be back again!!!YUMMY YUMMY, our favorite Mexican restaurant!\\n\\nWe r new to the area and searching for a Mexican place to fall in love with (tacos are my comfort food!!). We just sto happened to stumble upon this sweet place. \\n\\nChips and salsa are free of course and salsa is more on the tomatoey side than the spicy side. The service has always been quick, accurate, and kind. The menu is large with some lunch specials. I get soft tacos w refried beans and sour cream- SSOO GOOD, every time and the tacos are WAY BIGGER than what I\\'m used to!!'"
